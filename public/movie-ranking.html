<h1>THE BEST MOVIES ACCORDING TO AKSHAYA</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />
<h3>Ratchasan</h3>
<p>It's music and theme are the best till date. It is a complete combination of crime, thriller and family emotions</p>

<h3>Nanban</h3>
<p>This movie depicts the importance of friendship in our complicated lives. Its is a combination of comedy and a valuable moral at the end </p>

<h3>Mimi</h3>
<p>This contains the completely unspoken topic-surrogacy. This movie is filled with  things a young woman go through in her life and motherly emotions </p>
